Terminal window 1
Step 1: Copy the turtle5kdezyne folder to your catkin workspace (usually ~/catkin_ws)
Step 2: Open a terminal window and go to the catkin_ws folder
Step 3: Use the command: "catkin_make" to build the catkin workspace
Step 4: Use the command: "source devel/setup.bash" to update the references in your terminal (for 		auto completion)
Step 5: Use the command: "roslaunch turtle5kdezyne simulation.launch" to start the world model and the dezyne software

Terminal window 2
Step 6: Open a new terminal again use "source devel/setup.bash" (always in the catkin workspace)
Step 7: Use the following command below:

rostopic pub /t5k/ball_location turtle5kdezyne/BallLocation "found: true 
pose:
  header:
    seq: 0
    stamp:
      secs: 0
      nsecs: 0
    frame_id: ''
  pose:
    position:
      x: 0.0
      y: 0.0
      z: 0.0
    orientation:
      x: 0.0
      y: 0.0
      z: 0.0
      w: 0.0" 

The robot will only start to drive to the given location if the parameter "found" is true and
the orientation is valid (it uses Quaternions, easiest is to use x, y, z as 0 and w as 1.0).
From the position part only the "x" and "y" parameters are used.

Once you've done this, you should see the robot driving to the given location
