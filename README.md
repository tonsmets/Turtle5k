## Git flow
- Do NOT push directly to the master branch!! The 'dev' branch is our development 'place'.
- Create a new branch for all work you do and name it by it's JIRA name. For example: TURSOFT-11 Here goes a description
- Switch to the branch you made and do all your work here
  - When done with all work, pull the 'dev' branch to your own branch to get up-to-date with the latest changes by others
- Use clear messages in your commits. You could also name tickets from JIRA if needed
- Just before you make a pull request, pull the 'dev' branch to your own branch to get up-to-date with the latest changes by others
- Create a pull request to merge your own branch to 'dev'. You could also assign someone to look at it (not necessary)
- Wait until someone reviewed your pull request. If there are comments, fix the problems!
- Someone else will eventually merge your branch to 'dev'
- Don't screw up! If something is not clear, ask Ton!

## Algemene regels
- Don't commit and push non-working code! The code in your branches should always be able to run without errors
- You're not allowed to merge your own branches. This defeats the purpose of a pull REQUEST.
- Don't screw up! If something is not clear, ask Ton!
